What is tsints?
tsints is a parser for TypeScript types built entirely with TypeScript types. It converts a type-level string representation of a TypeScript type into a Babel-like AST that you can inspect at compile time. The parser is designed to be used in type-level tooling, type-driven code generation, and advanced type-safe meta-programming. It demonstrates how far you can push the TypeScript type system when parsing a small subset of TypeScript syntax.

Why use a type-level parser?
- No runtime cost: All work happens in the type system. When your code compiles, the parsed AST is available as types.
- Strong guarantees: The parser and AST carry the same type checks you apply to runtime code.
- Safe exploration: You can reason about types without touching runtime code, making it ideal for type-driven libraries and DSLs.
- Learn by example: It’s a compact case study in type-level computation and template literal types.
- Cross-version viability: The core ideas scale across TS versions that support template literal types and recursive conditional types.

How tsints works
- It uses TypeScript’s template literal types to tokenize the input string.
- It employs recursive conditional types to parse tokens and assemble an AST incrementally.
- The output mirrors a Babel-like AST subset, with node types such as TSTypeLiteral, TSPropertySignature, TSTypeAnnotation, TSTupleType, and TSTypeReference.
- It emphasizes determinism and simplicity. The parser targets a well-defined subset of TypeScript’s type syntax suitable for type-level processing.

Note about the test environment and expectations
- The parser is designed for strings that look like TypeScript type literals. It’s not a full JavaScript or TypeScript parser.
- The goal is to provide a deterministic, predictable AST for what’s expressible in type-level literals.
- If you need to parse full TS syntax, consider a runtime parser or a dedicated tool. tsints focuses on the type-level parsing angle.

What to expect in the API
- Parse<T extends string> is the entry point. It accepts a compile-time string literal that describes a TypeScript type.
- The result is a type that describes the AST. You can inspect or transform this AST with further type logic.
- The AST shape is inspired by Babel’s ESTree-like structure but adapted to TypeScript’s type system.
- The parser is designed to be pure and deterministic. Given the same input, you’ll get the same AST every time.

Usage: quick start
- The essential pattern is simple. Import the Parse type and apply it to a string literal that looks like a TS type.
- Example:
  - import type { Parse } from "./parser/index.ts";
  - type _ = Parse<"{some:[ts, 'type']}">;
  - The type _ resolves to an AST like a Babel parser node.

Two important notes on usage
- The input must be a string literal. The parser uses template literal types to read the content.
- The tokenizer assumes a subset of syntax that maps cleanly to an AST. If you try to parse something outside that subset, you’ll see a type error.

Future-proofing and compatibility
- tsints is designed to align with TypeScript’s evolving type system. As TS adds new template literal features, the parser can broaden its coverage.
- The implementation is conservative by default. It favors predictable error messages and stable AST shapes over chasing every edge of the TypeScript language.

Parses, tokens, and AST: a deeper look
- TSTypeLiteral: Represents an object-like type with a collection of members.
- TSPropertySignature: A property in a type literal, including its name, whether it’s computed, and its type annotation.
- Identifier: A variable or member name, used for keys in type literals and as type references.
- TSTypeAnnotation: The annotation attached to a type, which itself might wrap another type.
- TSTupleType: Represents a tuple type with ordered element types.
- TSTypeReference: A reference to a type by name, such as a built-in or a user-defined type.
- Example translation: A string like "{some:[ts, 'type']}" is parsed into a nested object that mirrors how Babel would represent a similar TS type.

A richer example
- Consider a slightly larger input:
  - type _ = Parse<"{name: string; age: number; tags: [string, boolean]}">;
  - The parsed AST would include:
    - type: "TSTypeLiteral"
    - members: [
      { type: "TSPropertySignature", key: { type: "Identifier", name: "name" }, computed: false, typeAnnotation: { type: "TSTypeAnnotation", typeAnnotation: { type: "TSStringKeyword" } } },
      { type: "TSPropertySignature", key: { type: "Identifier", name: "age" }, computed: false, typeAnnotation: { type: "TSTypeAnnotation", typeAnnotation: { type: "TSNumberKeyword" } } },
      { type: "TSPropertySignature", key: { type: "Identifier", name: "tags" }, computed: false, typeAnnotation: { type: "TSTypeAnnotation", typeAnnotation: { type: "TSTupleType", elementTypes: [ { type: "TSTypeReference", typeName: { type: "Identifier", name: "string" } }, { type: "TSTypeReference", typeName: { type: "Identifier", name: "boolean" } } ] } } }
    ]
  }

What you can build with tsints
- Compile-time schemas: Verify shapes of data structures used elsewhere in your codebase.
- Type-driven code generation: Create code templates based on parsed type representations.
- DSLs inside TypeScript: Define small DSLs represented as literal types and parsed into ASTs for transformation.
- Static validation: Use the AST to check invariants of types that appear in client code or library APIs.

Design decisions and architecture
- Pure type-level: No runtime parsing. All logic resides in TypeScript’s type system.
- Minimal surface area: A focused subset of TypeScript’s syntax that maps cleanly to an AST.
- Deterministic, readable errors: The parser aims to give helpful type errors when parsing fails.
- Extensibility: The code paths are designed to be extended with more node kinds, token rules, and error handling.
- Performance aware: Type-level computation can be costly. The implementation keeps recursion shallow where possible and emphasizes readability.

How to extend tsints
- Add new node types: Extend the AST with additional node kinds like TSInterfaceDeclaration or TSUnionType if you want to reflect more TS features.
- Expand grammar: Introduce more tokens and parsing rules for more TS constructs.
- Improve error messages: Add more context to failures to aid debugging in large strings.
- Provide utilities: Create type-level helpers that navigate the AST and extract meaningful information.

Limitations and caveats
- Scope: It handles a curated subset of TypeScript type syntax. It is not a full parser for the TS language.
- Compile-time costs: Large inputs cause deeper type-level recursion, which can affect compile times.
- Type version gaps: Some TypeScript versions may have different template literal type capabilities. Plan for backward compatibility or version gating.
- Error signals: Type-level errors can be verbose. The goal is to present clear signals about what failed and where.

Performance considerations
- Input size matters: Short literals parse quickly; long and nested literals take longer to reduce.
- Recursion depth: The parser uses recursive type patterns. There is a practical depth limit because of the TypeScript compiler’s recursion depth bounds.
- Caching: In complex codebases, you can implement helper types to cache intermediate AST fragments. This reduces repeat work in type evaluation.

Testing and quality
- Type-level tests: Validate that given an input string, the resulting AST matches the expected shape.
- Negative tests: Ensure that invalid inputs fail with helpful messages rather than producing silent or incorrect ASTs.
- Cross-TS compatibility tests: Check behavior across a range of TypeScript versions you aim to support.
- CI setup: A lightweight CI can run a battery of type tests automatically to catch regressions.

How to contribute

  - type Minimal = Parse<"{a: number}">;
  - Expected: An AST with a TSTypeLiteral node and a single member representing a property a of type number.
- A nested parse:
  - type Nested = Parse<"{foo: {bar: [string, true]}}">;
  - Expected: A nested TSTypeLiteral containing a TSPropertySignature whose typeAnnotation is another TSTypeLiteral, which in turn contains a TSTupleType.
- A union example:
  - type UnionExample = Parse<"{kind: 'a'|'b'|'c'}">;
  - Expected: An AST that models a union type in the property annotation.

Design tips for users
- Start small. Begin by parsing simple objects and gradually introduce more complexity.
- Use type-level tests to verify your expectations about the AST. Small, focused tests help catch subtle regressions.
- Maintain clarity in the AST. If you extend the AST, update the docs with clear examples that show how to navigate and interpret the structures.
